#### serverless

serverless !== no server it simply mean that you as the developer you don't have to care about the server behind the scene, so you can free yourself from configuring a server and creating and focus mostly on the front end since all of those are taken care of by a cloud provider.

being able to run backend code without creating and maintaining a server, so you simply put a function in your code that is managed by a cloud host, that can be scaled up and down.
