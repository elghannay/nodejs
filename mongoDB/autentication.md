#### understanding the authentication system.

> user of your database (the admins and data scientists) are assigned roles, each role has a number of privileges consist of actions and resources that a user can get access to ,like inserting a collection in such database...

> a user in this context does not mean a customer on your shop

#### creating and Editing users.

> The first user created in the database should be a user administrator who has the privileges to manage other users. See Enable Access Control.

`sudo mongod --auth`

> if you have already defined a user you may login to your db as `mongo -u name -p pass -authenticationDatabase admin` admin is the database that you have assigned the user initially.

> if it is your first time you get a localhost exception, which the ability to switch to admin database even if you haven't added any user.

> `use admin` > `db.createUser({ user: "mohamed",pwd: "elghannay", roles:["userAdminAnyDatabase"]})`
> after you created the user make sure to authenticate.

> `db.auth('mohamed','elghannay')` if the operation was successful `show dbs`

> to switch the user you should logout or just quit the terminal.
> make sure to switch first to the database that the user can have access to.(then create the user)

#### assigning more that one db to a user.

> one confusing thing that you should note though, always select first the db that a user has access to then try to authenticate.

`use admin`
`db.auth('max','max')` > admin login
`db.updateUser("appdev",{roles: ["readWrite",{role:"readWrite", db: "blog"}]})`

> update privileges for the appdev user, give em access to the blog database.
> to check the roles that a user has `db.getUser("appdev")`

> A user can have privileges across different databases. If a user requires privileges on multiple databases, create a single user with roles that grant applicable database privileges instead of creating the user multiple times in different databases.

#### Limit Network Exposure 

> Allow only trusted clients to access the network interfaces and ports on which MongoDB instances are available. For instance, use IP whitelisting to allow access from trusted IP addresses (see )

#### authentication vs authorization

> Although authentication and authorization are closely connected, authentication is distinct from authorization. Authentication verifies the identity of a user; authorization determines the verified userâ€™s access to resources and operations.
